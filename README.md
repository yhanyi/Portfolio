# Personal Portfolio Website

Deployed on Vercel at https://yeohhanyi.vercel.app/.

Hello! ðŸ‘‹

This is largely a migration of my first React portfolio from Javascript to Typescript, in which I try to implement more custom hooks such as a ThemeSwitch and ActiveSectionContext. There are quite a few bugs currently which I expect to smooth out over time since I plan to continue this website instead of creating a new one. I also plan to eventually add web analytics and improve optimization over time.
