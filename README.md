# Personal Portfolio Website

Deployed on Vercel at https://yhanyi.vercel.app/.

Hello! ðŸ‘‹

This is largely a migration of my first React portfolio from Javascript to Typescript, and trying to implement more custom hooks such as a ThemeSwitch and ActiveSectionContext. There are quite a few bugs currently which I expect to smooth out over time since I plan to continue this website instead of creating a new one. I also plan to add more 3D effects as well.

To run locally:

1. Clone the repo onto your local machine.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:yhanyi/portfolio.git
```
2. Open the folder.
```bash
cd yhanyi-portfolio
```
3. Install all packages and dependencies.
```bash
npm install
```
4. Start the app.
```bash
npm start
```
5. Visit http://localhost:3000.
